TYPO3 11.5
==========

Changes that should happen once we drop TYPO3 11.5.

Remove ``initializeObject()`` methods
-------------------------------------

Those are necessary prior v12 in order to properly initialize none re-constructed
data within Extbase models.
This vanished with v12 where ``makeInstance()`` is used which will call the ``__construct()`` method.

The content of the method should move to ``__construct()`` and the method should be removed.
