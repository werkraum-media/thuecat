PHP 7.4
=======

Changes that should happen once we drop PHP 7.4.

Remove ``symfony/polyfill-php80`` dependency
--------------------------------------------

We use PHP 8.0 functions within our code base (to not add legacy code and deprecations).

One example is :file:`Classes/Domain/Import/Import.php` where we use ``str_ends_with()``.
We therefore added ``symfony/polyfill-php80`` as composer package to already make use of those functions.

We can drop that package once we are at least on PHP 8.0.
