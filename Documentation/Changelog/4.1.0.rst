=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add TYPO3 wizard to select pages in configuration.
  That should ease live of editors, compared to manually inserting proper page uid.

* Add title to static import configuration.
  This title is auto filled on save with the titles of provided URLs.

Fixes
-----

Nothing

Tasks
-----

* Prevent creation of `composer.lock` file.
  As this is an extension without a lock state.
  We have different TYPO3 versions as supported versions and it should be easy to switch between them for testing and development.
