4.1.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add TYPO3 wizard to select pages in configuration.
  That should ease live of editors, compared to manually inserting proper page uid.

* Add title to static import configuration.
  This title is auto filled on save with the titles of provided URLs.

Fixes
-----

* Prevent `Error: Call to undefined method TYPO3\CMS\Core\Database\Schema\SchemaInformation::introspectTable()` with newer TYPO3 v13 versions.
  We now check for the old API, falling back to the new.
  All of this is still `@internal` TYPO3 API.

  The corresponding core change was commit `45a50e455955c78f6baa2aec3af3865101ee06b9`.
  We also need to update `codappix/typo3-php-datasets` dev dependency for the same reason.

* Handle 404 during import.
  Imports that would import a no longer existing resource resulted in a 503 Server Error.
  Those are now properly catched and logged. Those errors will no longer fail.

Tasks
-----

* Prevent creation of `composer.lock` file.
  As this is an extension without a lock state.
  We have different TYPO3 versions as supported versions and it should be easy to switch between them for testing and development.

* Streamline `phpstan.neon` formatting.

Deprecation
-----------

Nothing
