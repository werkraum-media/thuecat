2.1.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add command to allow import of a single configuration.
  The command is also available as scheduler task.
  This finally allows to regularly execute imports.
  This also allows to import from CLI context with differently configured timeouts.

Fixes
-----

* Catch mapping exceptions during converting entities.
  Those are handled the same way, the entity is skipped and errors are logged.
  That way further entities can be imported while only none working entities are skipped.

Tasks
-----

* Converted log entry for none converted entity from error to notice.
  As this might hint at an issue but most probably is okay, e.g. due to none active
  language, missing name, etc.

Deprecation
-----------

Nothing
