=====

Breaking
--------

* Media is no longer stored.
  Instead images are now properly stored as TYPO3 files.
  There is no upgrade wizard. Please migrate the database and re import the data to
  migrate existing imported data.

  TODO: Check this statement:
  The Templates also need adjustments, as the models have changed.

Features
--------

* Store referenced images within TYPO3.
  That way they can be combined with TYPO3 cropping features.
  Also the system does no longer need to load data from foreign sites, being more
  compliant without user consent.
