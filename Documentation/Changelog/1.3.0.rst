1.3.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

Add support for TYPO3 v11 and PHP 8.0 + 8.1.

Fixes
-----

* Allow to import objects (e.g. Tourist Attractions) which are managed by generic
  organisations instead of specific Tourist Marketing Company.
  Those organisations will now also be imported, just like Tourist Marketing Company before.
  Both are organizations internally and only used for the TYPO3 backend module.

* Handle multiple ``thuecat:offerType`` values within Offer.
  The API is none breaking, the models still return only a single offer.

  They will filter down to the first offer which contains ``Offer`` within the value.
  Examples:

  Given: Childcare and CourseOffer will result in CourseOffer.

  Given: Childcare will result in Childcare.

  Existing imported data is still handled.

Tasks
-----

Removed API Key from site configuration.
The key was already moved to extension configuration as documented.
Still we extended the site configuration, which is now cleaned up, see: https://github.com/werkraum-media/thuecat/issues/55

Deprecation
-----------

Nothing
